Approach:

- I choose to make the ai tracks the ball vertical position and move up and down to align its center with the ball.
- Higher difficulty means faster response and more accurate AI tracking.
- To make it more human like, I added an error offset that is larger at lower difficulties
- To increase the challenge over time, I implemented a speedMultiplier for the ball so it goes faster as the game go.

Obstacle:

- The paddle kept moving even when the ball didn't move so i made the paddle unable to move if the gameState was not "play"

* I had a problem when i added the offset which made the paddle lag a lot so i made sure the offset did not change with every frame

- The Ball was moving too quickly so i had to try a lot of multiplier so it had an appropriate change of speed.

Verification:

- I tested each time i added something by playing it and inspecting the page.

Use Of AI tools:
I used CHATGPT for idea to make the lower level more easy than just changing it speed. It gave me the idea of the offset.
I ask CHATGPT with some errors i could fix on my own.
I ask with ideas to make the paddle move less when my own did not do much of a difference.
It told me to make my offset stop changing every frame.
